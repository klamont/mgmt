About Me
----------

With 15 years of experience in high-tech work, I have developed the skills needed to lead diverse teams of engineers, while maintaining the highest standard of operational excellence.  I drive performance by defining effective and grounded KPIs, focusing my energy primarily on efficiency, cost, and service level.  I have strong opinions loosely held, and value a willingness to defend decisions based on data and experience. I promise to always treat people with respect, and to maintain a safe, productive atmosphere.
