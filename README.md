# Kevin Lamont's Manager Readme

## Background

I grew up in Naples, FL, and moved to the Boston area in 1999.  I have been working in Tech since the early 2000's, joined Akamai as a Network Engineer in 2008, and have been managing engineers since 2015.  During that time, I met and married my wife, and we have a son, Kieran.

My primary goals as a manager are to reduce the obstacles my team faces on a daily basis, as well as interface outwardly on how my teams can be most effective within the organization.  At the same time, I am committed to developing the skills of my team so that they can progress both within my company and in their careers.

## What to expect from me

I value relationships based on mutual respect, and a willingness to defend decisions based on data and experience.  I promise to always treat people with respect, and to maintain a safe, productive atmosphere.  I hold 1:1s with each of my direct reports, and try to do them weekly.  Any of my reports can schedule additional time with me if there is something you feel the need to discuss.  I believe in giving everyone on my team consistent, clear information (to the best of my ability), and setting goals that are aggressive, but achievable.

## What I expect from you

If you are a manager, please model a healthy work-life balance for your team.  Schedule and hold 1:1s with your reports, and hold me to my commitment to do the same for you.  If you are an engineer, please be open and honest about what is working, and what is not.  No matter who you are, work to build relationships outside of your immediate network, and share what you have learned with your team.  I am a strong proponent of continuing education, and urge my team to take advantage of their opportunities to learn new skills, by going deeper into technologies they find interesting, or broader, into new fields they may want to explore.   If at any time you feel that you are not being challenged, please speak up.  I will never consider someone voicing concerns to be a negative.

## On trying, and failure

I expect everyone on my team to try, always.  I also expect people to recognize when they are not the right person for a job, and when to ask for help.  I understand that no one is perfect, and that sometimes mistakes happen.  I believe in blameless incident reviews, and sharing knowledge gained from both successes and failures.

## What makes me happy

 - Seeing my team come up with inventive solutions to problems that have been pain points for too long.
 - Being able to publicly recognize my team for having completed a project.
 - Learning something new, especially when it comes from an unexpected source.

 ## What makes me grumpy

 - Lack of effort from people on my team.
 - "That's the way we've always done it" as an excuse.
 - Seeing people do things that should be automated.
